      Here you can see information about <a href="https://bsky.app">Bluesky</a> accounts and their interactions.
      The current features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <a href="/interactions">Interactions</a>: This feature organizes interactions such as
        replies, likes, and reposts between accounts on a weekly basis. You can also generate an
        image highlighting the accounts with the most interactions.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Interactions are divided into those initiated by the account and those received by the
            account. Interactions sent before November 1, 2023, may not be visible to all users yet,
            as they are currently being backfilled. Profiles that haven't been updated will receive
            priority for automatic updates when they are first searched.
          </li>
          <li>
            The total points are calculated as follows: <var
              >total = 2*replies + 2*reposts + 1*posts</var
            >
          </li>
